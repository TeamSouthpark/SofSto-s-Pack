		Animania-1.12.2-1.5.0:
			Animania

			Release Notes 1.5.0 (1.12.x only)

			“The Big Sleep”

			Features/Updates:

			 * All animals now Sleep during expected hours, provided they have a comfortable bed (credit: RaliaTheWolf… in 2017!)
			 * Each animal has a preferred bed block and backup (all fully configurable)
			 * By default animals prefer ‘Straw’ (a new block made from Wheat), and Grass as a backup
			 * Hedgehogs and Hamsters are noctural, Rabbits are crespuscular (awake at Dawn and Dusk only), the rest are diurnal (awake during day)
			 * Animals can be woken up by using a Lead
			 * Animals will also wake up if they are attacked or perceive a threat
			 * Sleep can be turned off in the config
			 * Tiller has been added:
			 * The Tiller turns grass blocks into Farmland, and can be bulled by Horses or Cows
			 * Attach the Tiller to an animal by using a Lead
			 * The Tiller can also auto-plant seeds. Sneak-Right-Click to open the Tiller’s 9-slot inventory and place seeds there
			 * You can pull a Cow or Horse with a Lead to plow and sow your land
			 * All animals can now eat and drink from Troughs (e.g., Peafowl, Rabbits, Hedgehogs, Ferrets, and Hamsters), (credit: Kitsufoxy)
			 * The Food that animals prefer is fully configurable. What you set in the config will be used for feeding animals by hand or from Troughs.
			 * Squids will no longer spawn in Fresh Water Lakes or Rivers. (This is configurable)
			 * All ‘Find’ AI has been re-built from the ground up to optimize performance (Food, Water, Salt Licks, Nests, Bed). Animals will give up on blocks they can’t reach, will prioritize block types properly, and will stop bunching into each other (credit: egorananyev, njtxus, polartwins, LunixNovalis)
			 * Animals will no longer be able to mate through walls or fences (credit: MonsterRa, Deshiba)
			 * The AI timer is now fully configurable. If you are experiencing lag issues, you can increase this timer and the AI will fire less frequently, improving performance.
			 * Animals show more respect in the case of overcrowding a block
			 * Unhappy ‘Smoke’ particles no longer appear on animals you find in the wild.
			 * Tamed animals no longer teleport to you (configurable, default is off).
			 * Hedgehogs and Hamsters avoid the bright sun

			 * Tamed animals no longer emit a heart every 10 seconds
			 * Arabic language support added (credit: m7md)
			Bug Fixes

			 * Added back a minimal replacement for vanila animals to animania, using a proximity sensor and existing cap to ensure no overspawning. Fixes the issue large modpacks were having not seeing any spawns, re-spawning issues, and existing worlds (credit: scienceman217, Deshiba, MrFarrell)
			 * Wagon disconnects less often on servers (credit: andrewminder)
			 * Cows drink water again (mxnmnm)
			 * Animania Wool is now searchable from the Creative Tab
			 * Pigs rotate less in mud
			 * Tamed animals no longer auto-sit when eating by hand
			 * Hedgehogs and Ferrets now eat all Egg types (make sure you reset your config)
			 * Animania animals no longer spawn when turned off in Config (credit: EmeraldTiger64)
			 * Jersey Cheese now in OreDictionary (credit: fullphaser)
			 * Roast Prime Steak now Cooked Prime Steak (credit: Deshiba)
			 * Removed ‘Dry’ Dimension from spawning parameters to limit spawning to Overworld biomes (credit: MauveCloud, kevinmd88)

	FoamFix for Minecraft (went from FoamFix 0.9.9.1 Anarchy (1.12.2) to FoamFix 0.10.1 (1.12.2)):
		FoamFix 0.10.1 (1.12.2):
			Additions:

			 * Patch for BlockStateContainer.getSerializedSize()-related crashes, found by Aaron1011 of Sponge
			 * Source: [https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeCommon/commit/a9423c7ec9f2b423b52c273f7e7a23818a8f3e41](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeCommon/commit/a9423c7ec9f2b423b52c273f7e7a23818a8f3e41)
			Changes:

			 * Performance optimizations to model deduplication.
			 * Memory and performance optimizations to block state property patch.
			 * Temporaily made texture animation optimization opt-in.
		FoamFix 0.10.0 (1.12.2):
			Please note that this is the formerly "Anarchy" version; the "Lawful" version is no longer distributed. You may reproduce its effects by disabling the coremod in foamfix.cfg, or you may build from source to get the Lawful JAR.

			Changes:

			 * Optimized model deduplication speed, though with the increased number of recursion it won't be noticeable in practice - however, it should lead to more RAM saved.
			 * The new recommended deduplicateModelsMaxRecursion value is 9. If you run into any issues, please let me know if the issues persist after setting the value back to 6!
			Bugs fixed:

			 * [GitHub/#162, GitHub/#127] Improve deduplication blacklist
			 * [GitHub/#153] Not detecting AMD/ATI cards on Linux with open drivers
			 * [GitHub/#115] Workaround for long-standing, undebuggable BiblioCraft issue

			6.1.BETA23
			- fixed banner server crash

			- fix soft-crash when you tried to craft a multiblock by clicking on the top or bottom face of a block with salis mundus
		Thaumcraft-1.12.2-6.1.BETA22.jar:
			6.1.BETA22

			- API: Additionally I have added an event mods can subscribe to that would be the correct place to define item aspects. The existing aspect definition methods will be deprecated and eventually will only be accessible through this event.

			- fix for pedestals incorrectly allowing more than one item to be placed in them via automation

			- pattern crafter now removes the proper amount of items
			- fixed possible dupe bug with certain mods combined with arcane bore, seals and breaker focus

	The Twilight Forest (went from Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.7.424 to Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.8.654):
		Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.8.654:
			ADDED:

			 * Added a Quadraxis to the team, A great addition to the mod.
			 * Added Auroralized Glass.
			 * Added actual Castle Brick Stairs, literally the sequel to Jesus.
			 * Cicadas can now be shot from an Immersive Engineering Railgun. You monster.
			 * Added the Skylight Forest.

			 * Skylight Forest is a skyblock variant of Twilight Forest with only structures generating on their own little islands and everything else as void.
			 * Parrots can now mimic any and all mobs in the mod. [PartyParrot]
			 * Added the Scepter of Fortification

			 * A new scepter dropped by the Lich that summons five (5) shields around you that each block a hit.
			 * Progression advancements each grant three (3) shields that don't decay over time.
			 * The Naga Can now be dazed if it rams a blocking shield with its charge attack, knocking you both backwards in the process.
			 * Giant Tools now have a longer reach.
			 * The uncrafting Table is now compatible with shapeless recipes. It totally didn't become twice as broken in potential!

			 * It can now also cycle through multiple recipes in case of conflict.
			 * Added tool shaders for Immersive Engineering with their own rarity, these include: Twilight, Firefly, Pinch Beetle, Snakestone, Mazestone, Underbrick, Towerwood, Carminite, Auroralized, Ironwood, Steeleaf, Knightly, Fiery, Final Castle, Cube of Annihilation, Questing Ram, Naga, Lich, Minoshroom, Hydra, Knight Phantom, Ur-Ghast, Alpha Yeti, Snow Queen.
			CHANGED:

			 * Druid Huts are no longer the number one fire hazard in the forest.

			FIXED:

			 * The file TFFeature has been split up into separate files, a massive improvement for large pregenerated worlds.
			 * Players can no longer spawn on top of the portal which would teleport them back into the overworld right away. Good lord that was annoying.

			 * Improved a lot of the logic relating to the Twilight Forest portal.
			 * Fixed an issue with Trophy Pedestal progression where it didn't unlock after the Lich.
			 * Remeasured the sizes of goblin's feet. Their boots should render on and fit them again.
